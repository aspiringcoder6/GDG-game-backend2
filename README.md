## Code Requirements

## Description 👨‍🎨
Quick, Draw! is an online game developed by Google that challenges players to draw a picture of objects or idea and then uses an AI model to guess what the drawings represent. The AI learns from each drawing, increasing its ability to guess correctly in the future.The concepts that it guesses can be simple, like 'foot', or more complicated, like 'animal migration'. This game is one of many simple games created by Google that are AI based as part of a project known as 'A.I. Experiments'. [Quick, Draw](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/)
